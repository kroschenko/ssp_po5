The condition of the finances of the state and city was most reprehensible. Both State and city were rich enough;
but there were so many schemes for looting the treasury in both instances that when any new work had to be undertaken
bonds were necessarily issued to raise the money. These bonds, or warrants, as they were called, pledged interest at
six per cent.; but when the interest fell due, instead of paying it, the city or State treasurer, as the case might be,
stamped the same with the date of presentation, and the warrant then bore interest for not only its original face value,
but the amount then due in interest. In other words, it was being slowly compounded. But this did not help the man who
wanted to raise money, for as security they could not be hypothecated for more than seventy per cent of their market
value, and they were not selling at par, but at ninety. A man might buy or accept them in foreclosure, but he had a long
wait. Also, in the final payment of most of them favouritism ruled, for it was only when the treasurer knew that certain
warrants were in the hands of "a friend" that he would advertise that such and such warrants - those particular ones
that he knew about - would be paid.
